## 🧠 What is AI Audio Generation?

AI Audio Generation means **creating sound using artificial intelligence**.

This sound can be:

* Human voice
* Music
* Sound effects
* Voiceovers

AI learns from thousands of real audio samples and then **creates new audio that sounds natural and human-like**.

## 🎤 Types of AI Audio Generation

There are four main types:

### 1️⃣ Text-to-Speech

AI converts written text into spoken voice.
Example: Audiobooks, voice assistants, announcements.

### 2️⃣ Voice Cloning

AI copies a specific human voice style.
Example: Personalized narration or character voices.

### 3️⃣ Music Generation

AI creates background music without instruments.
Example: Podcast intro music or YouTube background sound.

### 4️⃣ Sound Effects

AI generates sounds like rain, footsteps, or crowd noise.
